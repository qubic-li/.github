## Qubic Monero (XMR) Mining
As part of the Qubic Outsourced Computation initiative we built a PoC in which the Qubic AI Trainers mine partially Monero.
Currently there is a 50/50 portion between Qubic Ai Training and Monero XMR Mining.

Qubic has built it's own Monero Pool to demonstrate how a 3rd party can profit from the Qubic compute power.

With this, you can join Qubic. You will earn Qubic (not XMR). Join our [discord](https://discord.gg/FR32V3fyBW) server to get more information.
If just want to start, downlaod the [Client](https://github.com/qubic-li/client) and create your personal Account on [pool.qubic.li](https://pool.qubic.li).

Operating your own farm with farm connect allows you to minimize traffic and delay between your miners and the pool. It Works as a proxy between.
